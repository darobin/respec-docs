  <h2>preProcess</h2>
  <p>
    Expects an array of JavaScript functions. ReSpec invokes the these functions in order <em>before</em> 
    any other processing on the HTML occurs. As ReSpec includes jQuery, the <code>$</code> variable, 
    bound to a jQuery instance, is available from the global scope (i.e., <code>window.$</code>).
  </p>
  <p>
    Note: We strongly discourage the use of jQuery. We are trying to eliminate it from ReSpec and 
    encourage people to stop using it entirely. In modern browsers, jQuery is no longer a nessesary for cross-browser
    interoperability. Additionally, modern DOM APIs are now good enough that jQuery should not be needed for 
    manipulating or traversing DOM Nodes.
