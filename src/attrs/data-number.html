  <h2>data-number</h2>
  <p>
    Used in conjunction with the configuration option <code>issueBase</code> and with a paragraph with class value
    <code>issue</code>. The issue number is added to the header of the paragraph, linked to the issue by
    concatenating the values of <code>issueBase</code> and <code>data-number</code>. This is particularly useful 
    when using github to link into the discussion thread of a particular issue. A typical example for a file
    in the github repository <code>https:/github.com/w3c/dpub-pwd</code> would include, for example:
  </p>
  <pre><code>&lt;p class="issue" data-number="1"&gt;Change the terminology to "Portable Web Publication"&lt;\p&gt;</code></pre>
  <p>If the configuration of the file includes <code>issueBase:"https:/github.com/w3c/dpub-pwd/issues"</code>, then the paragraph will be automatically entitled "ISSUE 1", with a link to the corresponding Github issue entry (and there is a built-in CSS style statement to set the background color of the paragram).</p>
