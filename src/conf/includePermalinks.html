  <h2>includePermalinks</h2>
  <p>
    An option that tells the system to add a 'permalink' to each
    non-introductory section of your document assuming the
    section or heading element has an explicit ID.
    The permalink will show as an indicator on the same line
    as the section heading, by default immediately after the
    heading text. Options include:
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>permalinkSymbol</dt>
    <dd>The character(s) to use for the permalink indicator.
    The default symbol is 'ยง'.</dd>
    <dt>permalinkEdge</dt>
    <dd>Setting this to true tells the system to place the
    permalink indicator on the right edge of the page.  The
    default is to put the indicator immediately after the heading text.</dd>
    <dt>permalinkHide</dt>
    <dd>Setting this to true tells the system to hide the
    permalink symbol unless the heading is being hovered over.
    The default is to show the symbol at all times.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
    Finally, if you do not want a section to have a permlink
    indicator, a class of "nolink" on that heading will exclude
    it.
