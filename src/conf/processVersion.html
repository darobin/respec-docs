  <h2>processVersion</h2>
  <p>
    ReSpec knows to include an indication of the W3C process under which the document
    was developed.  This indication appears at the end of the Status of This Document
    section.  By default it indicates the new "2014" process.  You can override this by
    setting the processVersion configuration option to anything other than "2014".  The
    previous process document, for example, was "2005".
