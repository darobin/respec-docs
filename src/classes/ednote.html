  <h2>ednote</h2>
  <p>
    Marks the contents of an element as a "Editor's Note". If the element
    is a 'block' element (e.g., <code>div</code> or
    <code>p</code>) then the Editor's Note will be emitted in a 
    block that includes an Editor's Note "header" and the contents of the
    element as the text of the note.  
    If the element also has a
    <code>title</code> attribute, the content of the title will
    be appended to the header (e.g., "Editor's Note: This is my note").
    </p>

    <p>A block example:</p>
<pre>
&lt;p class="ednote" title="This section will be reformatted">
We are aware that the formatting of this section isn't great.  We
will fix it in the next revision!
&lt;p>
</pre>
    <p>Would be emitted as:</p>
<pre>
&lt;div class='ednote'>
    &lt;div class='ednote-title'>&lt;span>Editor's Note: This section will be reformatted&lt;span>&lt;div>
    &lt;p>We are aware that the formatting of this section isn't great. We
    will fix it in the next revision!&lt;p>
&lt;div>
</pre>
    <p>If the element is an 'inline' element (e.g., span) then the
    element is left as is and any <code>title</code> attribute 
    does not effect the appearance of the note.</p>
    <p>An inline example:</p>
<pre>
&lt;p>Sometimes, when you are looking at an URL
&lt;span class="note" title="Should this be 'an'?">I pronounce this
as 'earl', so 'An Earl' feels right.  But if I said the letters it is
'you are ell', so 'A You Are Ell' would be better.  Help?&lt;span>
note that the 'scheme' helps understand the rest of the syntax.&lt;p>
</pre>
    <p>Would be emitted as:</p>

    <p>In other words, the <code>title</code> attribute is ignored when the containing
    element is "inline".</p>
