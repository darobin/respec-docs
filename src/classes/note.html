  <h2>note</h2>
  <p>
    Marks the contents of an element as a "Note". If the element
    is a 'block' element (e.g., <code>div</code> or
    <code>p</code>) then the Note will be emitted in a 
    block that includes a Note "header" and the contents of the
    element as the text of the note.  
    If the element also has a
    <code>title</code> attribute, the content of the title will
    be appended to the header (e.g., "Note: This is my note").
    </p>

    <p>A block example:</p>
<pre>
&lt;p class="note" title="Always rely upon native semantics">
Remember - if you are using the &lt;code>role&lt;/code> attribute to say 
that a paragraph is a button, you are probably doing it wrong!
&lt;p>
</pre>
    <p>Would be emitted as:</p>
<pre>
&lt;div class='note'>
    &lt;div class='note-title'>&lt;span>Note: Always rely upon native semantics&lt;span>&lt;div>
    &lt;p>Remember - if you are using the &lt;code>role&lt;code> attribute to say 
    that a paragraph is a button, you are probably doing 
    it wrong!&lt;p>
&lt;div>
</pre>
    <p>An inline example:</p>
<pre>
&lt;p>This is really important: 
&lt;span class="note" title="PAY ATTENTION!">Try to imagine all
life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule
in your body exploding at the speed of light&lt;span> 
Don't cross the streams!&lt;p>
</pre>
    <p>Would be emitted as:</p>
<pre>
&lt;p>This is really important: 
&lt;span class="note" title="PAY ATTENTION!">Try to imagine all
life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule           
in your body exploding at the speed of light&lt;span>                       
Don't cross the streams!&lt;p>
</pre>
    <p>In other words, the <code>title</code> attribute is ignored when the containing
    element is "inline".</p>
