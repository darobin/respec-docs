        ReSpec is a tool that makes writing specifications easier.
        Specifications tend to follow all manners of formalism, and in some
        cases will follow a strict set of conventions (e.g. W3C's "PubRules").
        As an editor, you focus on actual features and correctness, ReSpec
        handle the likes of styling, referential integrity, bibliographical
        data, and a whole set of other dragons.

      <h2>
        Concepts
      </h2>
      <p>
        The fundamental ideas that underlie ReSpec are:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          It's Just HTML
        </dt>
        <dd>
          You just edit HTML, with some extra convention but nothing extra. All
          the decoration is performed by the script, informed by some very
          basic configuration. There is a simple <a href=
          'examples/template.html'>template</a> that you can use to get
          started.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          No Tool
        </dt>
        <dd>
          You never have to run a tool outside of your editor and browser.
          While the specification is being developed that's all that's needed.
          When a snapshot is needed for publication, all it takes is saving the
          generated DOM to a file (the script is very careful to cleanly remove
          itself and its dependencies so that you should normally get a
          document that's immediately PubRules-OK). Moving from an <em>Edit-Run
          Tool-Browser</em> cycle to an <em>Edit-Browser</em> cycle can
          obviously be shown to make editors 33% more efficient.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Specifications often require repetitive structure (e.g. the header
          boilerplate, table of contents), repetitive markup (e.g.
          cross-linking to definitions, identifying conformance requirements),
          repeated information (e.g. an interface definition and its unfolded
          description), and many other things that make the process slow,
          painful, and error-prone. ReSpec makes every attempt to either
          generate that information for you based only on what varies from
          document to document, and to avoid repeating information inside of a
          document by reusing information automatically as much as possible.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          DWIM (Do What I Mean)
        </dt>
        <dd>
          There are many things in specifications that are somewhat obvious,
          but which you have to take care of anyway. RFC 2119 statements need
          to be marked up for instance, or references to definitions need
          linking. These are all handled for you trivially, so that you can
          focus on breaking the web and forget about the annoying details.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          (Almost) All In The Browser
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Typical technical writing tools will work in three steps: 1) make
          changes to the document, 2) run some arcane processing tool that will
          turn it into a format that can be displayed, 3) refresh the display
          to see if the change looks right — then rinse and repeat. ReSpec gets
          rid of the second step by making all the processing happen in the
          browser, which is also the tool you use for step 3. By skipping one
          stage out of three, it will make you 33% more efficient as an editor.
          The only case in which you will need to play with a processing tool
          is when you need to publish a snapshot of your specification as
          static HTML. This part is somewhat less trivial than the iterative
          use of ReSpec while editing, but it should be rare enough (typically
          once every few months) that it should pose no major issue.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        There are many good existing tools that can be used to produce W3C
        specifications. A non-exhaustive list includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href='http://www.w3.org/2002/xmlspec/'>XMLSpec</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href='http://www.w3.org/Style/Group/css3-src/bin/postprocess'>CSS3
          Module PostProcessor</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href='http://anolis.gsnedders.com/'>Anolis</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href='http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/ReSpec/'>ReSpec</a> (Perl
          version)
        </li>
        <li>Many I forget...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But I was dissatisfied with all of them, including the one I wrote. The
        primary reason for that was that they all require one to run a tool in
        between editing and reloading the browser — an extra step that at the
        end of a long day's work editing is one step too many. Beyond that
        there are some smaller issues that I personally have with each, but it
        is largely a matter of taste.

        The first version of ReSpec was shipped in August 2009. Since then, it
        has become the most popular tool for specification editing at W3C. It
        benefits from a lively community of users that provide support to one
        another and contribute patches regularly. Now at version 3, it is a
        robust, full-featured tool surrounded by kind people.
