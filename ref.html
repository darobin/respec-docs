      <p>
        This chapter lists all the items (JS configuration, elements, attributes, classes) that
        can form the ReSpec language.

    <section>
      <h2>JavaScript Configuration Options</h2>
      <section>
  <h2>addPatentNote</h2>
  <p>
    Content that gets inserted at the end of the SotD; used in case the patent situation of your
    specification requires some specific mentions (e.g. for an ongoing PAG).
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>additionalCopyrightHolders</h2>
  <p>
    For regular documents, this is used to specify that additional parties hold a copyright jointly
    with W3C on this document. This is typically used when publishing documents that were developed
    in cooperation with other friendly SDOs such as the IETF. The option is simply some text giving
    the addition copyright holders. For unofficial documents, this string is used to replace the
    default CC licence. <a
    href='examples/boilerplate.html?additionalCopyrightHolders=Internet%20Engineering%20Task%20Force'>Example
    for regular documents</a> and <a
    href='examples/boilerplate.html?additionalCopyrightHolders=Copyright%20Â©%201977%20Robin%20Berjon;specStatus=unofficial'>example
    for unofficial documents</a>.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>alternateFormats</h2>
  <p>
    An array of objects, each of which has two required fields: <code>uri</code>, for the link to
    the alternate document, and <code>label</code>, for a human readable string that matches it.
    This is used to link to alternate formats for the same content (e.g. PDF, ePub, PS).
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>authors</h2>
  <p>
    An array of objects describing the authors of the document. See <a>editors</a> for details on
    the objects.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>charterDisclosureURI</h2>
  <p>
    For IG-NOTEs, this must be specified. It is the URL of IP disclosure as per the IG's charter.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>copyrightStart</h2>
  <p>
    ReSpec knows to include a copyright year that matches the <a>publishDate</a> in the copyright
    notice. However, for documents developed over a period of several years it is preferable to
    indicate the first year during which the copyright started by setting this option. Note that
    this can always be safely specified since if copyrightStart is the same as the publishDate's
    year it is ignored. <a href='examples/boilerplate.html?copyrightStart=1977'>See an example</a>.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>crEnd</h2>
  <p>
    A <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> date. Documents that are in Candidate Recommendation
    (<a>specStatus</a> is "CR") are required to indicate a date before which the group guarantees
    that it will not move to the next step on the track (PR or REC) so that implementers know how
    long they have. Use this to provide that date.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>diffTool</h2>
  <p>
    If you want to produce a diffmarked version of your specification, you can use this setting to
    point to a specific diff tool. It should expect to receive parameters called
    <code>oldfile</code>, <code>newcontent</code>, and <code>base</code>. By default it is set to
    <code>http://www.aptest.com/standards/htmldiff/htmldiff.pl</code>.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>edDraftURI</h2>
  <p>
    The URI of the Editor's Draft, used in the header. This is required for <a>specStatus</a> =
    "ED". Any good old URL will do the trick.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>editors</h2>
  <p>
    An array of objects describing the editors of the document (in order). Each object must follow
    the structure below:
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>name</dt>
    <dd>
      The name of the person. This field is required (and the only required one).
    </dd>
    <dt>url</dt>
    <dd>
      The URL for the person, can be used to point to the person's personal site.
    </dd>
    <dt>company</dt>
    <dd>
      The company for which the person is working.
    </dd>
    <dt>companyURL</dt>
    <dd>
      The URL for the above company.
    </dd>
    <dt>mailto</dt>
    <dd>
      An email with which to contact the person.
    </dd>
    <dt>note</dt>
    <dd>
      Additional information on the person, often used to indicate a former employer (if the person
      switched companies during edition) or to clarify that an editor is no longer active even if her
      name is still attached to the document out of respect for her past contributions.
    </dd>
  </dl>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>errata</h2>
  <p>
    An URL providing a link to a document capturing errata for the specification.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>extraCSS</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Deprecated</em>. An array of links to additional style sheets to include. This is one of the
    very few configuration options that is not backwards-compatible with v1 as support for it was
    completely removed (because almost everyone used it wrong, and it was not very useful).
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>implementationReportURI</h2>
  <p>
    The URL of the implementation report (documenting how your test suite fares with
    implementations), gets included in the specification's headers.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>lcEnd</h2>
  <p>
    A <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> date. Documents that are in Last Call (<a>specStatus</a> is "LC") are
    required to indicate an end date for the review period. Use this to provide it.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>localBiblio</h2>
  <p>
    If you need to include a one-off reference that isn't in the <a href='https://github.com/tobie/specref'>SpecRef database</a>
    or if you need to override an existing reference with specific content, then you can use this
    configuration option.
  </p>
  <p>
    Its value is an object that has the reference names as its keys and specific objects describing the
    references as its values. Keys include <code>authors</code> (an array of names), <code>href</code>
    (a link to the reference), <code>title</code> (the reference's name), <code>status</code>
    (its maturity as a standard), and <code>publisher</code> (the organisation publishing it).
    Only <code>title</code> is required.
  </p>
  <pre class='example highlight'>
    localBiblio:  {
        "WEREWOLF": {
            title:    "Tremble Puny Villagers"
        ,   href:     "http://w3.org/werewolf"
        ,   authors:  [
                "Dominique Hazael-Massieux"
            ,   "Doug the Simple Villager"
            ]
        ,   status:   "RSCND"
        ,   publisher:  "W3C"
        }
    }
  </pre>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>maxTocLevel</h2>
  <p>
    A number indicating the maximum depth of the table of contents, in case you wish to limit it
    so as to keep it more readable. Defaults to 0 which includes all levels.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>noLegacyStyle</h2>
  <p>
    A boolean indicating that automatically generated legacy DOM-style sections (Attributes and
    Methods) following the WebIDL blocks are removed. Setting this boolean true brings the document
    style closer to that of used by Anolis. If you are migrating a document that uses the legacy
    DOM-style, you need to manually move the prose from Attributes and Methods sections and put it
    below the IDL markup definition into its own paragraph(s). Additionally, you need to link the
    IDL members back to the prose; ReSpec automatically generates fragment identifiers that start
    with <code>#widl-</code>, and you must manually add corresponding <code>id</code>s to
    appropriate parts in your prose.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>noRecTrack</h2>
  <p>
    A boolean indicating that a document is not intended to become a Recommendation. Used for Notes
    while in unfinished maturity states.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>noTOC</h2>
  <p>
    When set to true, no table of contents is generated.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>otherLinks</h2>
    <p><code>otherLinks</code> gives you the ability to add additional links to the header
        of the document. This is useful if you want to link to other resources, like
        a news feed, a repository, or a relevant website.</p>
    <p>The <code>otherLinks</code> property takes an array that contains a set of objects.
        Each of these objects contains a `<code>key</code>` and a `<code>data</code>`
        property. The <code>`key`</code> is the text that will contain the links to
        the relevant resources. The `<code>data</code>` is another array of objects
        that contain the data describing the resource (with the properties `<code>value</code>`
        which is a string, and `<code>href</code>` which is the URL you want to link
        to).</p>
    <p>The above makes more sense when seen in an example:</p>
    <pre class='example highlight'>
otherLinks: [{
    key: "Version history:",
    data: [{
      value: "Commit History.",
      href: "https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/ri-usecases/commits/gh-pages"
 }, {
      value: "Github commits on Twitter.",
      href: "https://twitter.com/respimg_commits"
 }]</pre>
    <p>Becomes:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Version Histroy:</dt>
        <dd><a href="https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/ri-usecases/commits/gh-pages">Commit History.</a>
        </dd>
        <dt>Github commits on Twitter:</dt>
        <dd><a href="https://twitter.com/respimg_commits">Github commits on Twitter.</a>
        </dd>
    </dl>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>prevED</h2>
  <p>
    Sometimes it happens that a document is moved in the version control system, passed from one
    group to another, or split into several smaller documents. In such cases since the version
    control information is harder to find, this option can be used to point to a previous Editor's
    Draft. Rarely used.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>prevRecShortname</h2>
  <p>
    If you are working on a new version of an existing Recommendation, use this to indicate what
    its <a>shortName</a> was.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>prevRecURI</h2>
  <p>
    If you are working on a new version of an existing Recommendation, use this to indicate what
    its URL was.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a <a>prevRecURI</a> is not specified but <a>prevRecShortname</a> is, the latter will be used
    to generate the former by prefixing "http://www.w3.org/TR/" to it. Note however that while in
    the overwhelming majority of cases this works, it is not recommended to use this approach since
    if the Recommendation is later Rescinded, the link will be stale. Instead, use the dated link to
    the Recommendation.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>previousDiffURI</h2>
  <p>
    When producing a diffmarked version, ReSpec uses the <a>previousURI</a> as the old version by
    default. Use this configuration option if you wish to override this to a specific URL.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>previousMaturity</h2>
  <p>
    A <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> date. When a <a>previousPublishDate</a> is specified, this is
    typically required as well in order to generate the "Previous Version" link since it includes an
    indication of the previous document's maturity level, which cannot be guessed. The values are
    the same as for <a>specStatus</a>. Please note that some values of this option make no sense
    depending on the current document <a>specStatus</a> but that the rules for validating
    consistency are convoluted enough that ReSpec does not try to check them. If you pick the wrong
    value (typically by forgetting to change it), the Link Checker will most likely catch the error
    before publication (the same goes for <a>previousPublishDate</a>).
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>previousPublishDate</h2>
  <p>
    A <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> date. When there is a previous release of a given specification, this
    is used to generate the "Previous Version" link. It is required for Recommendation Track
    documents.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>previousURI</h2>
  <p>
    Not normally required, as this is typically defaulted properly for you. However, if the previous
    version of a document happened not to live on the W3C site (or not at a regular location) then
    you can set this.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>publishDate</h2>
  <p>
    A <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> date. The publication date of the present document. For documents that
    are in flux, such as Editor's Drafts or unofficial documents, this is best left unspecified as
    ReSpec will use the document's last modification date (as provided by the browser) in order to
    set this. For documents intended for official publication, this is normally required.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the last modified date provided by the browser can at times be wrong. This often
    happens when the server is itself providing a broken value, or at times when differences in
    timezones (that are not always well accounted-for by servers or browsers) cause the day to
    shift by one.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>refNote</h2>
  <p>
    The text of a note to include at the beginning of the References section.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>shortName</h2>
  <p>
    The specification's "short name", which is the name used in W3C URLs such as
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/short-name" (and several other generated URLs).
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>specStatus</h2>
  <p>
    The specification's type, which can be a maturity level (e.g. Working Draft) if it is on a
    publication track but can also take other values for other types of documents (e.g. "unofficial"
    for, well, unofficial documents).
  </p>
  <table class='table table-striped'>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>value</th>

      </tr>
    </thead>

      <tr><td>base</td>
        <td>

        <td>
          Member-Only Document. Similar to base, but for documents that need to be clearly flagged as

      <tr><td>unofficial</td>
        <td>
          An unofficial draft. Use this if you're producing a document outside of W3C but want

          while hosting it on your own server. Note that this automatically licences the content under CC-BY v3.0.
          If you want a different copyright, you will need to set the various copyright configuration
          options.

          called "CG-NOTE" is therefore a historical detail, if you are looking for Community Group

          seem to be solid rules for what constitutes a valid Finding SotD) so you'll have to
          specify your own. If there are rules that could be used, please report a bug. ReSpec
          further assumes some conventions for finding URLs that are not consistent throughout all
          of the TAG's repository, specifically that all findings live in
          "http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/", that the latest version is at

</section>

<section>
  <h2>wgPublicList</h2>
  <p>
    The short name of the mailing list on which the group conducts its public discussion. E.g.
    "public-device-apis".
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>wgURI</h2>
  <p>
    The URI to the public page of the group. E.g. "http://w3.org/2009/dap/".
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>xgrDocShortName</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Deprecated</em>. The short name of the group report, e.g. "mbui". Since XGs typically
    produce a single report, it is typical to use the same short name for the report as is used for
    the group, therefore this option defaults to <a>xgrGroupShortName</a>.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>xgrGroupShortName</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Deprecated</em>. The short name of the group, as included in its URI, e.g. "model-based-ui".
    This is required for XGs.

      <h2>Elements</h2>
      <section>
  <h2>figure</h2>
  <p>
    Specification figures are indicated using the <code>figure</code> element, with a nested
    <code>figcaption</code>. They can occur anywhere.
  </p>
  <p>
    A Table of Figures is generated and inserted in the document if you include an element with
    ID <code>tof</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Figures can be automatically linked to using a link pointing to their ID with no content
    (e.g. <code>&lt;a href='#foo-figures'>&lt;/a></code>).
  </p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>section</h2>
  <p>
    Specification sections are indicated using the <code>section</code> element. They can be
    nested arbitrarily in order to indicate sub-sections.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first <code>h*</code> child element is taken to be the section's title. You do not need to
    worry about nesting depth: ReSpec will take any element in the <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code>
    range and renumber it to match the section's nesting depth correctly. It is a common convention
    (though by no means a requirement) to use <code>h2</code> for all sections.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you nest deeper than the <code>h6</code> level, apart from having a hard-to-navigate document
    you will keep getting <code>h6</code> elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Section can be automatically linked to using a link pointing to their ID with no content
    (e.g. <code>&lt;a href='#foo-section'>&lt;/a></code>).
  </p>
  <section>
    <h2>Special sections</h2>
    <p>
      Some sections with specific IDs have special meanings.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>abstract</dt>
      <dd>
        <em>Required</em>. The specification's abstract, which should contain a paragraph. You shouldn't
        include the "Abstract" title.
      </dd>
      <dt>bp-summary</dt>
      <dd>
        If present, its content will be set to a summary of the list of best practices described in
        the document.
      </dd>
      <dt>conformance</dt>
      <dd>
        Specifications often have "Conformance Requirements", which are made of free-form text and
        some boilerplate mentioning RFC 2119. A section with this ID will add the title and the
        boilerplate, while keeping the content you include in it. The added paragraphs are
        essentially boilerplate but are useful in clarifying the normative status of specific
        sections and listing the RFC 2119 keywords that are normally used for testable assertions in
        the specification. The part that you write is dedicated to providing more information about
        how conformance works for your given specification, it is often used to define product
        conformance classes. If testable assertions and conformance classes sound like gibberish to
        you, it is highly recommended that you read <a
        href='http://www.w3.org/TR/test-methodology/'>http://www.w3.org/TR/test-methodology/</a>. In
        fact, even if you understand what those are but haven't read this document, go read it.
      </dd>
      <dt>sotd</dt>
      <dd>
        <em>Required</em>. The "Status of this Document" section. Obviously, you do not need to include the
        endless reams of boilerplate that that section normally contains: that's generated for
        you. However, the PubRules require that part of that boilerplate be "a custom paragraph".
        The content you include in this section is therefore injected as that custom paragraph (you
        can have several, in fact any markup you want is used). Don't spend too much time putting
        together the best of your prose for this, it is almost certain that no one will ever read
        it.
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </section>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>title</h2>
  <p>
    The <code>title</code> element is left untouched, but its content is used to also set the
    <code>h1</code> title for the specification.
  </p>
</section>


    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Attributes</h2>
      <section>
  <h2>data-include-format</h2>
  <p>
    Data is normally included as HTML (injected into the DOM as such) but there are time when you
    want to include content as text. If so, set this attribute to <code>text</code>. That is the
    only supported value (you can also use <code>html</code>, but that's the default behaviour).
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>data-include-replace</h2>
  <p>
    By default inclusion happens by placing the content inside the including element. At time, you
    will actually want the element to be replaced by the inclusion. If so, simply set this attribute
    to any truthy value.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>data-include-sync</h2>
  <p>
    Inclusion is normally asynchronous, which means that the content may or may not get further
    processed by ReSpec depending on the point at which it gets inserted (which isn't 
    deterministic). If you need to ensure that content gets injected before the rest of the
    pipeline runs, set this to any truthy value.
  </p>
  <p>
    Be warned that there is a steep performance penalty in doing so, since all ReSpec processing
    will effectively pause until the content has been fully fetched and inserted.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>data-include</h2>
  <p>
    A URL pointing to a resource, relative to the including document. The content will get included
    as a child of the element on which the inclusion is performed (unless
    <code><a>data-include-replace</a></code> is used, in which case it replaces the element),
    replacing its existing content.
  </p>
  <p>
    The include filter runs recursively so that included content that contains
    <code><a>data-include</a></code> attributes will work (just be sure not to build a circular loop
    in there, ReSpec won't detect it if only because it doesn't mind if you're shooting yourself in
    the foot).
  </p>
  <p>
    By default the inclusion is asynchronous, which means that the included content may or may not
    be further processed by ReSpec after it gets added to the DOM (the result won't be deterministic
    and so is only useful if the content is <em>not</em> meant to be further processed). If you wish
    to ensure that ReSpec processing is applied to the content, use
    <code><a>data-include-sync</a></code>
  </p>
  <p>
    In the processing pipeline, inclusion happens right after everything to do with the document's
    headers, style, and transformations have happened, which means that all the processing to do
    with structure, inlines, WebIDL, and everything else is applied to the included content as if it
    had always been part of the source.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>data-merge</h2>
  <p>
    This is a list of white space separated WebIDL identifiers that you wish to have merged into
    the current WebIDL section, so as to have them all described together rather than as separate
    sections. This is typically used to bring the definition for one or more dictionaries into the
    same section as an interface.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>data-oninclude</h2>
  <p>
    Behaves in the same way as <code><a>data-transform</a></code>, applied to the included content.
    The functions receive a third parameter giving the URL of the loaded content.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>data-transform</h2>
  <p>
    This is a list of white space separated JavaScript function names that will be called in turn
    in order to transform the content inside the given element. The functions need to be globally
    available.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each function gets called with the ReSpec <code>utils</code> object and a string of the content
    to transform.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each function must return the transformed content.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>dir</h2>
  <p>
    ReSpec defaults the <code>dir</code> attribute on your root element to <code>ltr</code>. If you
    are writing in a language that requires a different directionality, simply set this attribute to
    another value.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>lang</h2>
  <p>
    ReSpec defaults the <code>lang</code> attribute on your root element to <code>en</code>. If you
    are writing in another language, simply set this attribute to another value.
  </p>
</section>


    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Classes</h2>
      <section>
  <h2>appendix</h2>
  <p>
    Marks a section as being an appendix (which will be numbered with letters). Note that this does
    not make it informative as some appendices can contain normative material.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is important to know that every section following an appendix will also be made to be an
    appendix.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>example</h2>
  <p>
    Marks a <code>pre</code> or <code>div</code> as being an example. This provides it with a
    specific styling and header.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>highlight</h2>
  <p>
    Indicates that an example or a code fragment should be syntax highlighted. The syntax highlighter
    will do its best to guess how to perform highlighting without knowing the language.
  </p>
  <p>
    If needed you can tweak the syntax highlighting styles in order to obtain better results.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>informative</h2>
  <p>
    Used for regular sections or appendices that are not meant to contain normative material. It
    will automatically preface its content with the well-know âThis section is non-normativeâ
    paragraph.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>introductory</h2>
  <p>
    When set on a section indicates that it is meant as introductory material that need not be
    linked to from the table of contents. The abstract, SotD, and ToC sections automatically fall
    into this category (but you need not worry about flagging them as such).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you <em>do</em> wish all the introductory sections to be present in the ToC, see
    <a>tocIntroductory</a>.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>practice</h2>
  <p>
    A <code>div</code> containing a best practice description.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>practicedesc</h2>
  <p>
    A paragraph containing the description of a best practice, inside a <a>practice</a> description.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>practicelab</h2>
  <p>
    A <code>span</code> containing the title of a best practice, inside a <a>practice</a>
    description.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>remove</h2>
  <p>
    If you want to include content that is used during the generation of the specification but must
    be removed from the output, then add the <code>remove</code> class to it. That is used for
    instance for all the <code>script</code> elements that pull in ReSpec and define its
    configuration.
