  <h2>doRDFa</h2>
  <p>
    A setting indicating what version of RDFa to use when annotating the specification with semantic
    information that is compatible with RDFa Processors as used in the major search engines.  Legal values are
    "1.0" to generate RDFa 1.0-compatible semantic markup, "1.1" to generate RDFa 1.1-compatible semantic
    markup, and false to indicate that
    no RDFa information should be included at all.  Defaults to "1.1".
  </p>
  <p class='note'>The values "1.0" and "1.1" must be included in quotation marks.  Also, the value "1.0"
  should not be used in new specifications - it is only supported for legacy reasons.
