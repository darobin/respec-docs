        ReSpec is a tool that makes writing specifications easier.
        Specifications tend to follow all manners of formalism, and in some
        cases will follow a strict set of conventions (e.g. W3C's "PubRules").
        As an editor, you focus on actual features and correctness, ReSpec
        handle the likes of styling, referential integrity, bibliographical
        data, and a whole set of other dragons.
