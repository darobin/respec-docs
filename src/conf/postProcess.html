  <h2>postProcess</h2>
  <p>
    Takes an array of JavaScript functions. The functions are invoked in the order <em>after</em>
    ReSpec has processed the HTML source. As ReSpec includes jQuery, the <code>$</code> variable, bound 
    to a jQuery instance, is available within each function.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note: We strongly discourage the use of jQuery. We are trying to eliminate it from ReSpec and 
    encourage people to stop using it entirely. In modern browsers, jQuery is no longer a nessesary for cross-browser
    interoperability. Additionally, modern DOM APIs are now good enough that jQuery should not be needed for 
    manipulating or traversing DOM Nodes.
